# ðŸš€ Running AI Compliance Flask App with Docker

Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t ai-compliance .
```

Run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5005:5005 ai-compliance
```

Then open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:5005
```

The container runs `python app.py`, so the Flask app listens on port 5005.
